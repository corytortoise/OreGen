# OreGen
A plugin for PMMP to change the resulting block of lava and water colliding!
Cobble/Stone/Obsidian generators can produce any blocks, in any rarity.
This plugin works well with SkyBlock plugins, but can be used without one.

##How to Use
Simply download the .phar, and drop it in your PMMP plugins folder. Start your server, and the plugin will run automatically. If you want to edit the blocks and their rarities, access the config.yml file from your server's plugin_data folder. Instructions are included in the config file. Save it when you're done, and restart the server for it to take effect.
